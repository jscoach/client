### Setting up JS.coach

#### Search with Algolia

Duplicate the existing `.env` file in the root directory of this subproject and name it `.env.local`.
This file is already on the `.gitignore` file so you don't accidentally commit it to your repository.
Visit the algolia website and fill the following environment variables:

```bash
# Algolia configs
REACT_APP_ALGOLIA_APP_ID="<your-app-id>"
REACT_APP_ALGOLIA_API_KEY="<your-search-api-key>"
```

Your primary index is used to browse libraries by popularity
(it uses stars, downloads and dependents to rank a library)
and also to sort the results by relevance when the user is searching.
We will now create a replica so the user can browse libraries sorted by "updated at" too.

Open your index page on Algolia and click on the "Replicas" tab.
Click "Add a value" to create a replica index with a name such as "Library_updated_at_development".
If you gave either your primary index or the replica names that don't match the defaults,
you can update the following variables on the `.env` file:

```bash
# List of primary indexes and replicas to search in
REACT_APP_INDEX_BY_RELEVANCE="<your-primary-index-name>"
REACT_APP_INDEX_BY_UPDATED_AT="<your-replica-index-name>"
```

#### Deploying to GitHub pages

GitHub Pages doesnâ€™t support routers that use the HTML5 `pushState` history API under the hood.
To work around that we use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to the `index.html` page with a special redirect parameter.
You can find a detailed explanation of this technique [in this guide](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).

If you are setting up a Project Pages site and not using a custom domain (i.e. your site's address is `username.github.io/repo-name`),
then you need to set `segmentCount` to `1` in the `404.html` file in order to keep `/repo-name` in the path after the redirect.

Apart from that, deployment works exactly as usual for apps created using `create-react-app`.
